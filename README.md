# CS-Programs-Fellowships-Insights

Curated list of programs, fellowships, insight series, and more for CS students. Many lists exist for internships, but not for other types of resources.

An initative of ColorStack at Binghamton University. Follow us on instagram @colorstackbu

Inspiration goes to @codicate for making the [underclassman version](https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships) thats kitted with tons of internships and programs dedicated to underclassmen that this is based off of.

Will do my best to update frequently Stars & PR appreciated!!
